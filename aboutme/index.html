    <p>
      My name is Divine and I am from Nigeria. I am studying Applied Technology
      with a major in Software Development at BYU-Idaho. I am passionate about
      programming, and I have a dream of building complex and beautiful
      websites. I am currently in a one-year self bootcamp where I am learning
      new skills and technologies to achieve my coding goals.

      I love the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and I have been a
      member since 2017. One of my favorite scriptures is Doctrine and Covenants
      88:118: “And as all have no faith, seek ye diligently and teach one in
      other words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom;
      seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” This scripture inspires
      me to seek learning and wisdom in all aspects of my life.

      I am excited to take this course again because I want to learn more about
      web design and development. I had to withdraw from this course before due
      to lack of motivation, but now I am determined to ace it with the help of
      Heavenly Father. I hope to gain valuable knowledge and experience from
      this course that I can use in my personal and professional life.
