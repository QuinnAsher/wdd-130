    <h1>Portfolio Showcase</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Welcome to my portfolio showcase!</strong> In this showcase, I've meticulously curated a selection of my most significant web design projects, offering you a glimpse into my skills and creativity. Each project featured here signifies a distinct journey in web design, where my expertise in HTML and CSS has been thoughtfully applied to create websites that are both visually captivating and highly functional.
    </p>
        <h2>Project 1: [Order Summary]</h2>
        <p>My "Order Summary" project was born from a challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project encompasses a responsive webpage, presenting a crystal-clear overview of orders that seamlessly adapts to both desktop and mobile views. Key highlights include a user-friendly design that combines aesthetic excellence and ingenious problem-solving. It serves as a testimony to my unwavering commitment to delivering top-notch web solutions.</p>

        <h2>Project 2: [Product Preview]</h2>
        <p>Once again, I took inspiration from Frontend Mentor for the creation of the "Product Preview" project. It's a responsive webpage designed to offer a captivating sneak peek into the world of Chanel perfume. Despite initial challenges with the “picture” and “srcset” tags, I successfully engineered a seamless user experience across mobile and desktop devices. This experience has been invaluable, equipping me with knowledge to excel in future projects.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: [Result Summary]</h2>
        <p>
            My journey led me back to Frontend Mentor for yet another dose of inspiration. The "Result Summary" project is a striking example of my commitment to flexibility and responsiveness. It's a hypothetical result summary page, meticulously constructed with the powerful Flexbox layout. Its inherent flexibility allows it to effortlessly adapt to screens of various sizes, maintaining a polished appearance.
        </p>

        <h2>Project 4: [Stat Preview Card]</h2>
        <p>Continuing my exploration of Frontend Mentor challenges, I present to you the "Stat Preview Card." This project showcases a meticulously designed stats page, brought to life through a harmonious fusion of HTML and CSS. Its most remarkable aspect lies in its responsiveness; it ensures a superb user experience whether you're viewing it on a mobile device or a desktop computer.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
       <p>Hello, I'm Divine, a dedicated web developer with a passion for creating user-friendly websites. My journey in web development began when I joined a degree program offered by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Despite having limited tech knowledge at the time, I chose the software development path, and I've been immersed in web development ever since. My goal is to become a full-stack developer within the next five years.</p>
        <p>With around two years of experience, I've honed my skills in HTML and CSS while staying updated with the latest design trends and technologies. I've also had the privilege of collaborating with fellow developers on more complex projects.</p>
    <p>This website is more than just a showcase of my work; it's an invitation to connect and work together. I believe in the power of great design to convey messages and leave a lasting impression. Whether you're an employer in search of a passionate developer or a fellow developer looking to enhance your skills, I'm here to share my knowledge and experience.</p>
